  supercomputer \href{https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa}{Lisa} to perform
  large-scale linguistic annotation of dutch documents with

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

This document describes a system for large-scale linguistic annotation
of documents, using supercomputer
\href{https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa}{Lisa}. Lisa is a
computer-system co-owned by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This
document is especially useful for members of the Computational
Lexicology and Terminology Lab (\CLTL{}) who have access to that
computer. Currently, the dopcuments to be processed have to be encoded
in the \emph{NLP Annotation Format}
(\href{https://github.com/newsreader/NAF}{\NAF}).

The annotation of the documents will be performed by a ``pipeline''
that has been set up in the
Newsreader-project~\footnote{http://www.newsreader-project.eu}. 

\subsection{How to use it}
\label{sec:usage}


Quick user instruction:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get an account on Lisa.
\item Clone the software from Github. This results in a directory-tree
  with root \verb|m4_progname|.
\item ``cd'' to \verb|m4_progname|.
\item Create a subdirectory \verb|in| and fill it with (a
  directoy-structure containing) raw \NAF's
  that have to be annotated.
\item Run script \verb|runit|.
\item Wait until it has finished.
\end{enumerate}

The following is a demo script that performs the installation and
annotates a set of texts:

@o ../demoscript @{@%
#!/bin/bash
gitrepo=m4_progrepo
xampledir=/home/phuijgen/nlp/data/examplesample/
#
git clone $gitrepo
cd m4_progname
mkdir -p data/in
mkdir -p data/out
cp $xampledir/*.naf data/in/
./runit
@| @}

@% \section{Elements of the job}
@% \label{sec:elements}

\subsection{How it works}
\label{sec:how}

\subsubsection{Moving files around}
\label{sec:filestructure}

The \NAF{} files and the logfiles are stored in the following subdirectories of the \verb|data|:

\begin{description}
\item[in:] To store the input \NAF{}'s.
\item[proc:] Temporary storage of the input files while they are being processed.
\item[fail:] For the input \NAF's that could not be processed.
\item[log:] For logfiles.
\item[out] The annotated files appear here.
\end{description}

The user stores the raw \NAF{} files in directory \verb|data/in|. She
may construct a structure with subdirectories in \verb|data/in| that
contain the \NAF{} files. If she does that, the system copies this
file-structure in the other subdirectories of \verb|data|.  Processing
the files is performed by jobs. Before a job processes a document, it
moves the document from \verb|in| to \verb|proc|, to indicate that
processing this document has been started.

When the job is not able to perform processing to completion
(e.g. because it is aborted), the \NAF{} file remains in the
\verb|proc| subdirectory. A management script moves \NAF{} of which
processing has not been completed back to \verb|in|.

While processing a document, a job generates log information and
stores this in a log file with the same name as the input \NAF{} file
in directory \verb|log|. If processing fails, the job moves the
input \NAF{} file from \verb|proc| to
\verb|fail|. Otherwise, the job stores the output \NAF{} file in
\verb|out| and removes the input \NAF{} file from \verb|proc| 

@d parameters @{@%
export walltime=m4_walltime
export root=m4_aprojroot
export intray=m4_indir
export proctray=m4_procdir
export outtray=m4_outdir
export failtray=m4_faildir
export logtray=m4_logdir
@| walltime root intray outtray failtray logtray @}


\subsubsection{Managing the documents with Stopos}
\label{sec:docmanagement}

The processes in the jobs that do the work pick \NAF{} files from \verb|data/in|
in order to process them. There must be a system that arranges that
each \NAF{} file is picked up by only one job-process. To do this, we
use the
\href{https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/software/stopos}{``Stopos''}
system that is implemented in Lisa. A management script makes a list
of the files in \verb|\data\in| and passes it to a ``stopos
pool'' where the work processes can find them.

Periodically the management script moves unprocessed documents from
\verb|data/proc| to \verb|data/in| and regenerate the infilelist in the
Stopos pool.

A list of files to be processed is called a ``Stopos pool''. 

@d parameters @{@%
export stopospool=m4_stopospool
@| stopospool @}

Load the stopos module in a script:

@d load stopos module @{@%
module load stopos
@| stopos module @}

\subsubsection{Management script}
\label{sec:managementscript}

A management script \verb|runit| set the system to work and keep
the system working until all input files have been processed until either
successful completion or failure. The script must run periodically in
order to restore unfinished input-files from \verb|data/proc| to
\verb|data/in| and to submit enough jobs to the job-system.

\subsubsection{Job script}
\label{sec:jobscript}

The management-script submits a Bash script as a job to the
job-management system of Lisa. The script contains special parameters
for the job system (e.g. to set the maximum processing time). It
generate a number of parallel processes that do the work.

To enhance flexibility the job script is generated from a template
with the M4 pre-processor.

\subsubsection{Set parameters}
\label{sec:parameters}

The system has several parameters that will be set as Bash variables
in file \verb|parameters|. The user can edit that file to change
parameters values

@o m4_projroot/parameters @{@%
@< parameters @>
@| @}


\section{Files}
\label{sec:files}

Viewed from the surface, what the pipeline does is reading, creating,
moving and deleting files. The input is a directory tree with \NAF{}
files, the outputs are similar trees with \NAF{} files and log
files. The system generates processes that run at the same time, reading files from the
input tree. It must be made certain that each file is processed by
only one process. This section describes and builds the directory
trees and the ``stopos'' system that supplies paths to input \NAF{}
files to the processes.

\subsection{Move NAF-files around}
\label{sec:filemoving}

The user may set up a structure with subdirectories to store the input
\NAF{} files. This structure must be copied in the other data
directories.

@% The following two macro's copy resp.{} move a file that is presented
@% with it's full path from a source data directory to a similar path in a
@% target data-directory. Arguments:
@% 
@% \begin{enumerate}
@% \item Full path of sourcefile.
@% \item Full path of source tray.
@% \item Full path of target tray
@% \end{enumerate}
@% 
@% @d copy file @{cp @1 $@3/${@1##$@2}@| @}
@% 
@% @d move file @{mv @1 $@3/${@1##$@2}@| @}

The following bash functions copy resp.{} move a file that is presented
with it's full path from a source data directory to a similar path in a
target data-directory. Arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Full path of sourcefile.
\item Full path of source tray.
\item Full path of target tray
\end{enumerate}

The functions can be used as
\href{http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/158564/how-to-use-defined-function-with-xargs}{arguments
  in \texttt{xargs}}.

@d functions @{@%
function movetotray () {
local file=$1
local fromtray=$2
local totray=$3
local frompath=${file%/*}
local topath=$totray${frompath##$fromtray}
mkdir -p $topath
mv $file $totray${file##$fromtray}
}

export -f movetotray

@| movetotray @}

@d functions @{@%
function copytotray () {
local file=$1
local fromtray=$2
local totray=$3
local frompath=${file%/*}
local topath=$totray${frompath##$fromtray}
mkdir -p $topath
cp $file $totray${file##fromtray}
}

export -f copytotray

@| copytotray @}

\subsection{Count the files and manage directories}
\label{sec:bookkeeping}

When the management script starts, it checks whether there is an input
directory. If that is the case, it generates the other directories if
they do not yet exist and then counts the files in the
directories. The variable \verb|unreadycount| is for the total number
of documents in the intray and in the proctray. 

@d check/create directories @{@%
@% infilesexist=1
@% if
@%   [ ! -d "$intray" ]
@% then
@%   echo "No input-files."
@%   echo "Create $intray and fill it with raw NAF's."
@%   veilig
@%   exit 4
@% fi
mkdir -p $outtray
mkdir -p $failtray
mkdir -p $logtray
mkdir -p $proctray
@< count files in tray @(intray@,incount@) @>
@< count files in tray @(proctray@,proccount@) @>
@< count files in tray @(failtray@,failcount@) @>
@< count files in tray @(logtray@,logcount@) @>
unreadycount=$((incount + $proccount))
@< remove empty directories @>
@| infilesexist incount proccount failcount logcount @}

@% \subsection{Reset if there are no files to be processed}
@% \label{sec:reset}
@% 
@% If it turns out that there are no files to be processed, reset the system:
@% \begin{itemize}
@% \item Delete outstanding jobs.
@% \item Purge the stopos pool.
@% \item Set jobcounter to zero.
@% \item move remaining joblogfiles.
@% \end{itemize}
@% 
@% 
@% @d check/create directories @{@%
@% if
@%   [ ! "$(ls -A $intray)" ] &&  [ ! "$(ls -A $proctray)" ]
@% then
@%   echo "Finished processing"
@%   veilig
@%   exit
@% fi
@% @| @}



@d count files in tray @{@%
@2=`find $@1 -type f -print | wc -l`
@| @}

Remove empty directories in the intray and the proctray.
@d remove empty directories @{@%
find $intray -depth -type d -empty -delete
find $proctray -depth -type d -empty -delete
mkdir -p $intray
mkdir -p $proctray
@| @}

\subsection{Generate pathnames}
\label{sec:generatefilenames}

When a job has obtained the name of a file that it has to process, it
generates the full-pathnames of the files to be produced, i.e. the
files in the proctray, the outtray or the failtray and the logtray:

@d generate filenames @{@%
filtrunk=${infile##$intray/}
export outfile=$outtray/${filtrunk}
export failfile=$failtray/${filtrunk}
export logfile=$logtray/${filtrunk}
export procfile=$proctray/${filtrunk}
export outpath=${outfile%/*}
export procpath=${procfile%/*}
export logpath=${logfile%/*}
@| filtrunk outfile logfile procfile outpath procpath logpath @}

\subsection{Manage list of files in Stopos}
\label{sec:manage-by-stopos}

\subsubsection{Set up/reset pool}
\label{sec:poolsetup}

The processes obtain the names of the files to be processed from
Stopos. Adding large amount of filenames to the stopos pool take much
time, so this must be done sparingly. We do it as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First look how many filenames are still available in the
  pool. If the pool is empty, or there are no files in the intray, or
  there are no jobs, the pool must be renewed. On the other hand,
  if there are still lots of filenames in it, we can leave the pool alone.
\item If the pool is running out, something has to be done:
\item Generate a file \verb|infilelist| that contains the paths to the files in
  the intray.
\item Assume file \verb|old.filenames|, if it exists, contains the
  filenames that have been inserted in the Stopos pool.
\item Delete from \verb|old.filenames| the names of the
  files that are no longer in the intray. They have probably been
  processed or are being processed.
\item  Move the files in the proctray that are not actually being
  processed back the intray. We know that these files are not being
  processed because either there are no running jobs or the files reside
  in the proctray for a longer time than jobs are allowed to run.
\item Make file \verb|infilelist| that lists files that are
  currently in the intray.
\item Check whether the listed filenames are present in
  \verb|old.filenames| and remove them from  \verb|infilelist| when
  that is the case. Put the result in  \verb|new.filenames|.
\item Add the files in \verb|new.filenames| to the pool.
\item Add the content of \verb|new.filenames| to \verb|old.filenames|.
\end{enumerate}

It seems that the file-bookkeeping that is external is sometimes
flawed and therefore we renew the pool as often as we can.


When we run the job -manager twice per hour, Stopos needs to contain
enough filenames to keep Lisa working for the next half hour. Probably
Lisa's job-control system does not allow us to run more than 100 jobs
at the same time. Typically a job runs seven parallel processes. Each
process will probably handle at most one \NAF{} file per minute. That
means, that if stopos contains $100 \times 7 \times 30 = 21 10^{3}$
filenames, Lisa can be kept working for half an hour.

First let us see whether we will update the existing pool or purge and
renew it. We renew it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When there are no files in the intray, so the pool ought to be empty;
\item When there are no jobs around, so renewing the pool does not
  interfere with jobs running.
\item When the pool status tells us that the pool is empty.
\end{enumerate}

The following macro sets the first argument variable to ``1'' if the pool
does not exist or if it contains less then
m4_sufficient_stopos_entries filenames. Otherwise, it sets the
variable to ``0'' (true). It sets the second argument variable similar
when there no filenames left in the pool.

@% \item Generate the output-tray to store the processed \NAF{}'s
@% \item Generate a Stopos pool with a list of the filenames of the NAF

@% \item Move a failed inputfile to the fail-tree
@% \end{enumerate}
@% 
@% Generate the directories to store the files when they are not yet
@% there.

\section{Jobs}
\label{sec:jobs}

\subsection{Manage the jobs}
\label{sec:manage-jobs}


The management script submits jobs when necessary. It needs to do the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Count the number of submitted and running jobs.
\item Count the number of documents that still have to be processed.
\item Calculate the number of extra jobs that have to be submitted.
\item Submit the extra jobs.
\end{enumerate}

Find out how many submitted jobs there are and how many of them are
actually running. Lisa supplies an instruction \verb|showq| that
produces a list of running and waiting jobs. Unfortunately, it seems
that this instruction shows only the running jobs in job
arrays. Therefore we need to make job bookkeeping.

File \verb|jobcounter| lists the number of jobs. When extra jobs are
submitted, the number is increased. When logfiles are found that job
produce when they end, the number is decreased. 

@d count jobs @{@%
if
  [ -e jobcounter ]
then
  export jobcount=`cat jobcounter`
else
  jobcount=0
fi
@| @}

Count the logfiles that finished jobs produce. Derive the number of
jobs that have been finished since last time. Move the logfiles to
directory \verb|joblogs|. It is possible that jobs finish and produce
logfiles while we are doing all this. Therefore we start to make a
list of the logfiles that we will process.

@d count jobs @{@%
cd $root
ls -1 m4_jobname<!!>.[eo]* >jobloglist
finished_jobs=`cat jobloglist | grep "\.e" | wc -l`
@% finished_jobs=`ls -1 $root/m4_jobname<!!>.e* | wc -l`
mkdir -p joblogs
cat jobloglist | xargs -iaap mv aap joblogs/
if
  [ $finished_jobs -gt $jobcount ]
then
  jobcount=0
else
  jobcount=$((jobcount - $finished_jobs))
fi
@| @}

Extract the summaries of
the numbers of running jobs and the total number of jobs from the job
management system of Lisa.

\subsection{Generate and submit jobs}
\label{sec:generate-jobs}

A job needs a script that tells what to do. The job-script is a Bash
script with the recipe to be executed, supplemented with instructions
for the job control system of the host. In order to perform the Art of
Making Things Unccesessary Complicated, we have a template from which
the job-script can be generated with the
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/m4.html}{M4 pre-processor}.

Generate job-script template \verb|job.m4| as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the job-script with the wall-time parameter (the maximum duration that is allowed
for the job).
\item Add an instruction to change the M4 ``quote'' characters.
\item Add the M4 template \verb|m4_jobname|.
\end{enumerate}

Process the template with \texttt{M4}.


@d generate jobscript @{@%
echo "m4_<!!>define(m4_<!!>walltime, $walltime)m4_<!!>dnl" >job.m4
m4_changequote(<![!>,<!]!>)m4_dnl
echo 'm4_[]changequote(`<!'"'"',`!>'"'"')m4_[]dnl' >>job.m4
m4_changequote([<!],[!>])m4_dnl
cat m4_jobname<!!>.m4 >>job.m4
cat job.m4 | m4 -P >m4_jobname
# rm job.m4
@| @}


Submit the jobscript. The argument is the number of times that the
jobscript has to be submitted.

@d submit jobs @{@%
 @< generate jobscript @>
 jobid=`qsub -t 1-@1 m4_aprojroot/m4_jobname`
@| @}

\section{Logging}
\label{sec:logging}

There are three kinds of log-files:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every job generates two logfiles in the directory from which it
  has been submitted (job logs).
\item Every job writes the time that it starts or finishes processing
  a naf in a \emph{time log}.
\item For every \NAF{} a file is generated in the log directory. This
  file contains the standard error output of the modules that
  processed the file.
\end{enumerate}


@% \subsection{Job logs}
@% \label{sec:joblogs}
@% 
@% While we are busy with file-bookkeeping, let us handle the job-logs
@% too. When a job finishes it produces two files that contain standard
@% output and standard error of the log. We remove logfiles that are more
@% than a day old. Job-logs have the same name as the job. The extension
@% begins with character \verb|o| (output) or  \verb|e|, followed by a number.
@% 
@% @d remove old joblogs @{@%
@% find $root -name "m4_jobname.[eo]*" -cmin +<!!>m4_maxjoblogminutes -delete
@% @| @}


\subsection{Time log}
\label{sec:Timelog}

Keep a time-log with which the time needed to annotate a file can be
reconstructed.

@d parameters @{@%
export timelogfile=m4_logdir/timelog
@| @}

@d add timelog entry @{@%
echo `date +%s`: @1 >> $timelogfile
@| @}

@d log that the job starts @{@%
@< add timelog entry @(Start job $jobname@) @>
@| @}

@d log that the job finishes @{@%
@< add timelog entry @(Finish job $jobname@) @>
@| @}




@% \subsubsection{Stopos: file management}
@% \label{sec:filemanagement}
@% 
@% Stopos stores a set of parameters (in our case the full paths to
@% \NAF{} files that have to be processed) in a named ``pool''. A process
@% in a job can
@% read a parameter value from the pool and the Stopos system makes sure that
@% from that moment no other process is able to obtain that parameter value. When the job
@% has finished processing the parameter value, it removes the parameter value from
@% the pool.

@% \subsubsection{Generate a Stopos pool}
@% \label{sec:generate_pool}
@% 
@% When the script is started for the first time, hopefully raw \NAF{}
@% files are present in the intray, but there are no submitted jobs. When
@% there are no jobs, generate a new Stopos pool. Otherwise, there ought
@% to be a pool. To update the pool, restore files that resided for longer
@% time in the proctray into the intray and re-introduce them in the pool.

@% @d (re-)generate stopos pool @{@%
@% if
@%   [ $running_jobs -eq 0 ]
@% then
@%   @< set up new stopos pool @>
@% else
@%   @< restore old procfiles @>
@% fi
@% @| @}


@% Move files that reside longer than \verb|maxproctime| minutes back to
@% the intray. This works as follows:
@% 
@% \begin{enumerate}
@% \item function \verb|restoreprocfile| moves a file back to the intray
@%   and adds the path in the intray to a list in file \verb|restorefiles|.
@% \item The Unix function \verb|find| the old procfiles to function
@%   \verb|restoreprocfile|.
@% \item When the old procfiles have been collected, the filenames in
@%   \verb|restorefiles| are passed to Stopos.

\section{Processes}
\label{sec:processes}

A job runs in computer that is part of the Lisa supercomputer. The
computer has a \CPU{} with multiple cores. To use the cores
effectively, the job generates parallel processes that do the
work. The number of processes to be generated depends on the number of
cores and the amount of memory that is available.

\subsection{Calculate the number of parallel processes to be launched}
\label{sec:processes_to_be_launched}

The stopos module, that we use to synchronize file management,
supplies the instructions \verb|sara-get-num-cores| and
\verb|sara-get-mem-size| that return the number of cores resp. the
amount of memory of the computer that hosts the job. \textbf{Note}
that the stopos module has to be loaded before the following macro can
be executed succesfully.

@d determine amount of memory and nodes @{@%
export ncores=`sara-get-num-cores`
#export MEMORY=`head -n 1 < /proc/meminfo | gawk '{print $2}'`
export memory=`sara-get-mem-size`
@| memory ncores @}


We want to run as many parallel processes as possible, however we do
want to have at least one node per process and at least an amount of
\verb|m4_memperprocess| GB of memory per process.

@d parameters @{@%
mem_per_process=m4_memperprocess
@| @}

Calculate the number of processes to be launched and write the result
in variable \verb|maxprogs|.

\subsection{Perform the processing loop}
\label{sec:procloop}

processes it.

\section{Apply the pipeline}
\label{sec:pipeline}

This section finally deals with the essential purpose of this
software: to annotate a document with the modules of the pipeline.

The pipeline is installed in directory \verb|m4_pipelineroot|. For
each of the modules there is a script in subdirectory \verb|bin|.

@d parameters @{@%
export pipelineroot=m4_pipelineroot
export BIND=$pipelineroot/bin
@| @}




\subsection{Spotlight server}
\label{sec:spotlightserver}

Some of the pipeline modules need to consult a \emph{Spotlight server}
that provides information from DBPedia about named entities. If it is
possible, use an external server, otherwise start a server on the host
of the job. We need two Spotlight servers, one for English and the
other for Dutch. We expect that we can find spotlight servers on host
\verb|m4_spotlighthost|, port m4_spotlight_nl_port for Dutch and
m4_spotlight_en_port for English. If it turns out that we cannot
access these servers, we have to build Spotlightserver on the local
host.

@% @d check/start spotlight @{@%

@% spothost_en=check_start_spotlight "en"

\subsection{Language of the document}
\label{sec:language}

Our pipeline is currently bi-lingual. Only documents in Dutch or
English can be annotated. The language is specified as argument in the
\verb|NAF| tag. The pipeline installation contains a script that
returns the language of the document in the \NAF{}. Put the language
in variable \verb|naflang|.

Select the model that the Nerc module has to use, dependent of the language.

@d retrieve the language of the document  @{@%
naflang=`cat @1 | m4_pipelineroot/bin/langdetect`

then
  export nercmodel=nl/nl-clusters-conll02.bin
else
  export nercmodel=en/en-newsreader-clusters-3-class-muc7-conll03-ontonotes-4.0.bin
fi
@| nercmodel @}



\subsection{Apply a module on a NAF file}
\label{sec:apply_module}

For each NLP module, there is a script in the \verb|bin| subdirectory
of the pipeline-installation. This script reads a \NAF{} file from
standard in and produces annotated \NAF{}-encoded document on standard
out, if all goes well. The exit-code of the module-script can be used
as indication of the success of the annotation.

To prevent that modules are applied on the result of a failed
annotation by a previous module, the exit code will be stored in
variable \verb|moduleresult|. 

The following function applies a module on the input naf file, but
only if variable \verb|moduleresult| is equal to zero. If the
annotation fails, the function writes a fail message to standard error
and it sets variable \verb|failmodule| to the name of the module that
failed. In this way the modules can easily be concatenated to annotate
the input document and to stop processing with a clear message when a
module goes wrong. The module's output of standard error is concatenated to the
logfile that belongs to the input-file. The function has the following arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Path of the input \NAF{}.
\item Module script.
\item Path of the output \NAF{}.
\end{enumerate}


@d functions in the pipeline-file @{@%
function runmodule {
infile=\$1
modulecommand=\$2
outfile=\$3
@% logfile=\$4
if
  [ $moduleresult -eq 0 ]
then
  cat $infile | $modulecommand > $outfile 2>>$logfile
  moduleresult=$?
  if
    [ $moduleresult -gt 0 ]
  then
    failmodule=$modulecommand
@%     echo Failed: process $procnum";" file $infilefullname";" module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult >&2
     echo Failed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult >>$logfile
     echo Failed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult >&2
     echo Failed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult
     cp $outfile out.naf
     exit $moduleresult
  else
     echo Completed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult >>$logfile
     echo Completed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult >&2
     echo Completed: module $modulecommand";" result $moduleresult
  fi
fi  
}

\subsection{Perform the annotation on an input NAF}
\label{sec:perform}

When a process has obtained the name of a \NAF{} file to be processed
and has generated filenames for the input-, proc-, log-, fail- and
output files (section~\ref{sec:generatefilenames}, it can start
process the file:

@d process infile @{@%
movetotray $infile $intray $proctray
mkdir -p $outpath
mkdir -p $logpath
export TEMPDIR=`mktemp -d -t nlpp.XXXXXX`
cd $TEMPDIR
@< retrieve the language of the document @($procfile@) @>
moduleresult=0
timeout m4_timeoutsecs $root/apply_pipeline
pipelineresult=$?
@< move the processed naf around @>
cd $root
rm -rf $TEMPDIR
@| pipelineresult timeout @}

We need to set a time-out on processing, otherwise documents that take
too much time keep being recycled between the intray and the
proctray. The bash timeout function executes the instruction that is
given as argument in a subshell. Therefore, execute processing in a
separate script. The subshell knows the exported parameters in the
environment from which the timeout instruction has been executed.

\subsection{The jobfile template}
\label{sec:jobfiletemplate}

Now we know what the job has to do, we can generate the script. It
executes the functions \verb|passeer| and \verb|veilig| to ensure that
the management script is not  

@o m4_projroot/m4_jobname.m4 @{@%
m4_<!!>changecom()m4_dnl
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -lnodes=1
<!#!>PBS -lwalltime=m4_<!!>walltime

( $BIND/start_eSRL $piddir )&
export jobname=$PBS_JOBID

echo spotlighthost: $spotlighthost
@% @< function getfile @>
starttime=`date +%s`
@< run parallel processes @>
@< log that the job finishes @>
exit

@| @}



\subsection{Synchronisation mechanism}
\label{sec:synchronisation}

Make a mechanism that ensures that only a single process can execute
some functions at a time. Currently we only use this to make sure that
only one instance of the management script runs. This is necessary
because loading Stopos with a huge amount of filenames takes a lot of
time and we don not want that a new instance of the management script
interferes with this.

The script \verb|sematree|, obtained from
\url{http://www.pixelbeat.org/scripts/sematree/} allows this kind of
``mutex'' locking. Inside information learns that sematree is
available on Lisa (in \verb|m4_sematree_script_location|). To lock
access Sematree places a file in a \emph{lockdir}. The directory where
the lockdir resides must be accessable for the management script as
well as for the jobs. Its name must be present in variable
\verb|workdir|, that must be exported.

@d initialize sematree @{@%
export workdir=m4_aworkdir
mkdir -p $workdir
@| @}

Now we can implement functions \verb|passeer| (gain exclusive access)
and \verb|veilig| (give up access).


@d functions @{@%
function passeer () {
  local lock=$1
  sematree acquire $lock
}

function runsingle () {
  local lock=$1
  sematree acquire $lock 0 || exit
}


function veilig () {
  local lock=$1
  sematree release $lock
}

@| passeer veilig @}

Occasionally a process applies the \verb|passeer| function, but is
aborted before it could apply the \verb|veilig| function.  

@d functions @{@%

function remove_obsolete_lock {
  local lock=$1
  local max_minutes=$2
  if
    [ "$max_minutes" == "" ]
  then
   local max_minutes=60
  fi
  find $workdir -name $lock -cmin +$max_minutes -print | xargs -iaap rm -rf aap
}
@| @}


\subsubsection{Count processes in jobs}
\label{sec:processescounter}

When a job runs, it start up independent sub-processes that do the
work and it may start up servers that perform specific tasks (e.g. a
Spotlight server). We want the job to shut down when there is nothing
to be done. The ``wait'' instruction of Bash does not help us, because
that instruction waits for the servers that will not stop. Instead we
make a construction that counts the number of processes that do the
work and activates the exit instruction when there are no more
left. We use the capacity of sematree to increment and decrement
counters. The process that decrements the counter to zero releases a
lock that frees the main process. The working directory of sematree
must be local on the node that hosts the job.

@d init processescounter @{@%
export workdir=`mktemp -d -t workdir.XXXXXX`
sematree acquire finishlock
@| workdir finishlock @}


@d increment the processes-counter @{@%
sematree acquire countlock
proccount=`sematree inc countlock`
sematree release countlock
@| countlock @}

@d decrement the processes-counter, kill if this was the only process @{@%
sematree acquire countlock
proccount=`sematree dec countlock`
sematree release countlock
echo "Process $proccunt stops." >&2
if
  [ $proccount -eq 0 ]
then
  sematree release finishlock
fi
@| @}

@d wait for working-processes @{@%
sematree acquire finishlock
sematree release finishlock
echo "No working processes left. Exiting." >&2
@| @}
 




@% The processes that execute these functions can crash and they are
@% killed when the time alotted to them has been used up. Thus it
@% is possible that a process that executed \verb|passeer| is not able to
@% execute \verb|veilig|. As a result, all other processes would come to a
@% halt. Therefore, check the age of the lock directory periodically and
@% remove the directory when it is older than, say, an hour.
@% 
@% @d remove old lockdir  @{@%
@% @%export LOCKDIR=m4_lockdir
@% find \$workdir/m4_lockfile -amin m4_locktimeout -print 2>/dev/null | xargs rm -rf
@% @| @}
@% 
@% @% The synchronisation mechanism can be used to have parallel processes
@% @% update the same counter. 
@% @% 
@% @% @d increment filecontent @{@%
@% @% passeer
@% @% NUM=`cat @1`
@% @% echo \$((NUM + 1 )) > @1
@% @% veilig

@% @% 
@% @% @d decrement filecontent @{@%
@% @% passeer
@% @% NUM=`cat @1`
@% @% echo \$((NUM - 1 )) > @1
@% @% veilig
@% @% @| @}
@% 
@% We use the synchronisation as follows: when a management script
@% starts, it looks whether jobs are running. If that is not the case it
@% updates Stopos in a critical section (between commands \verb|passeer|
@% en \verb|veilig|). If jobs start, they begin to axecute \verb|passeer|
@% and \verb|veilig|, so they can only go on when not a management
@% script is updating Stopos. Theoretically, this can go wrong when a job
@% starts and passes its critical sectiion  between the moment that the
@% management script counts the jobs and starts the critical
@% section. However, starting jobs takes a lot of time, so I assume that
@% this will not happen frequently.
@% 
@% 
@% 
@% We will need a mechanism to find out whether a certain operation has
@% taken place within a certain past time period. We use the timestamp of
@% a file for that. When the operation to be monitored is executed, the
@% file is touched. The following macro checks such a file. It has the
@% following three arguments: 1) filename; 2) time-out period; 3)
@% result. The result parameter will become true when the file didn't
@% exist or when it had not been touched during the time-out period. In
@% those cases the macro touches the file.

\appendix

\section{How to read and translate this document}
\label{sec:translatedoc}

This document is an example of \emph{literate
  programming}~\cite{Knuth:1983:LP}. It contains the code of all sorts
of scripts and programs, combined with explaining texts. In this
document the literate programming tool \texttt{nuweb} is used, that is
currently available from Sourceforge
(URL:\url{m4_nuwebURL}). The advantages of Nuweb are, that
it can be used for every programming language and scripting language, that
it can contain multiple program sources and that it is very simple.


\subsection{Read this document}
\label{sec:read}

The document contains \emph{code scraps} that are collected into
output files. An output file (e.g. \texttt{output.fil}) shows up in the text as follows:

\begin{alltt}
"output.fil" \textrm{4a \(\equiv\)}
      # output.fil
      \textrm{\(<\) a macro 4b \(>\)}
      \textrm{\(<\) another macro 4c \(>\)}
      \(\diamond\)

\end{alltt}

The above construction contains text for the file. It is labelled with
a code (in this case 4a)  The constructions between the \(<\) and
\(>\) brackets are macro's, placeholders for texts that can be found
in other places of the document. The test for a macro is found in
constructions that look like:

\begin{alltt}
\textrm{\(<\) a macro 4b \(>\) \(\equiv\)}
     This is a scrap of code inside the macro.
     It is concatenated with other scraps inside the
     macro. The concatenated scraps replace
     the invocation of the macro.

{\footnotesize\textrm Macro defined by 4b, 87e}
{\footnotesize\textrm Macro referenced in 4a}
\end{alltt}

Macro's can be defined on different places. They can contain other macro's.

\begin{alltt}
\textrm{\(<\) a scrap 87e \(>\) \(\equiv\)}
     This is another scrap in the macro. It is
     concatenated to the text of scrap 4b.
     This scrap contains another macro:
     \textrm{\(<\) another macro 45b \(>\)}

{\footnotesize\textrm Macro defined by 4b, 87e}
{\footnotesize\textrm Macro referenced in 4a}
\end{alltt}


\subsection{Process the document}

 shows pathways to
translate it into printable/viewable documents and to extract the
program sources. Table~\ref{tab:transtools}

\end{table}
lists the tools that are
needed for a translation. Most of the tools (except Nuweb) are available on a
well-equipped Linux system.

@%\textbf{NOTE:} Currently, not the most recent version  of Nuweb is used, but an older version that has been modified by me, Paul Huygen.

\subsection{Get Nuweb}
\label{sec:getnuweb}

An annoying problem is, that this program uses nuweb, a utility that
is seldom installed on a computer. Therefore, we are going to install
that first if it is not present. Unfortunately, nuweb is hosted on
sourceforge and it is difficult to achieve automatic downloading from
that repository. Therefore I copied one of the versions on a location
from where it can be downloaded with a script.

Put the nuweb binary in the nuweb subdirectory, so that it can be used before the directory-structure has been generated.

\subsection{Pre-processing}
\label{sec:pre-processing}

To make usable things from the raw input
\verb|a_<!!>m4_progname<!!>.w|, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Process \verb|\$| characters.
\item Run the m4 pre-processor.
\item Run nuweb.
\end{enumerate}

This results in a \LaTeX{} file, that can be converted into a \pdf{}
or a \HTML{} document, and in the program sources and scripts.

\subsubsection{Process `dollar' characters }
\label{sec:procdollars}

Many ``intelligent'' \TeX{} editors (e.g.\ the auctex utility of
Emacs) handle \verb|\$| characters as special, to switch into
mathematics mode. This is irritating in program texts, that often
contain \verb|\$| characters as well. Therefore, we make a stub, that
translates the two-character sequence \verb|\\$| into the single
\verb|\$| character.

\item Create a \pdf{} document.
\item Print the typeset document.
\item View the typeset document with a viewer.
\item Create a \HTML document.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

\texttt{xfig}. Post-process the figures to enable inclusion in this
document.

The list of figures to be included:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%

We use the package \texttt{figlatex} to include the pictures. This
package expects two files with extensions \verb|.pdftex| and
\verb|.pdftex_t| for \texttt{pdflatex} and two files with extensions \verb|.pstex| and
\verb|.pstex_t| for the \texttt{latex}/\texttt{dvips}
combination. Probably tex4ht uses the latter two formats too.

Make lists of the graphical files that have to be present for
latex/pdflatex:

\subsubsection{Bibliography}
\label{sec:bbliography}

To keep this document portable, create a portable bibliography
file. It works as follows: This document refers in the
\texttt|bibliography| statement to the local \verb|bib|-file
\verb|m4_progname.bib|. To create this file, copy the auxiliary file
to another file \verb|auxfil.aux|, but replace the argument of the
command \verb|\bibdata{m4_progname}| to the names of the bibliography
files that contain the actual references (they should exist on the
computer on which you try this). This procedure should only be
performed on the computer of the author. Therefore, it is dependent of
a binary file on his computer.


@d expliciete make regels @{@%

	m4_mkportbib m4_progname m4_bibliographies

\subsubsection{Create a printable/viewable document}
\label{sec:createpdf}

Make a \pdf{} document for printing and viewing.

@d make targets @{@%
pdf : m4_progname.pdf

print : m4_progname.pdf
	m4_printpdf(m4_progname)

view : m4_progname.pdf
	m4_viewpdf(m4_progname)

@| pdf view print @}

Create the \pdf{} document. This may involve multiple runs of nuweb,
the \LaTeX{} processor and the bib\TeX{} processor, and depends on the
state of the \verb|aux| file that the \LaTeX{} processor creates as a
by-product. Therefore, this is performed in a separate script,
\verb|w2pdf|.

\paragraph{The w2pdf script}
\label{sec:w2pdf}

The three processors nuweb, \LaTeX{} and bib\TeX{} are
intertwined. \LaTeX{} and bib\TeX{} create parameters or change the
value of parameters, and write them in an auxiliary file. The other
processors may need those values to produce the correct output. The
\LaTeX{} processor may even need the parameters in a second
run. Therefore, consider the creation of the (\pdf) document finished
when none of the processors causes the auxiliary file to change. This
is performed by a shell script \verb|w2pdf|.

@%@d make targets @{@%
@%m4_progname.pdf : m4_progname.w \$(FIGFILES)
@%	chmod 775 bin/w2pdf
@%	bin/w2pdf m4_progname
@%
@%@| @}



@% Note, that in the following \texttt{make} construct, the implicit rule
@% \verb|.w.pdf| is not used. It turned out, that make did not calculate
@% the dependencies correctly when I did use this rule.
@% 
@% @d  impliciete make regels@{@%
@% @%.w.pdf :
@% %.pdf : %.w \$(W2PDF)  \$(PDF_FIG_NAMES) \$(PDFT_NAMES)
@% 	chmod 775 \$(W2PDF)
@% 	\$(W2PDF) \$*
@% 
@% @| @}

@% Unfortunately, the above rule does not seem to work as expected. When
@% the Makefile is invoked while  \texttt{nlpp.pdf} doens not exists,
@% make produces the following message:
@% 
@% \begin{verbatim}
@% paul@@klipperaak:/mnt/sdb1/pipelines/testnlpp/nlpp/nuweb$ make pdf
@% make: *** No rule to make target `nlpp.pdf', needed by `pdf'.  Stop.
@% 
@% \end{verbatim}
@% 
@% Therefore we add the following explicit rule:


@d make targets @{@%
m4_progname<!!>.pdf : m4_progname<!!>.w \$(W2PDF)  \$(PDF_FIG_NAMES) \$(PDFT_NAMES)
	chmod 775 \$(W2PDF)
	\$(W2PDF) \$*

The following is an ugly fix of an unsolved problem. Currently I
develop this thing, while it resides on a remote computer that is
connected via the \verb|sshfs| filesystem. On my home computer I
cannot run executables on this system, but on my work-computer I
can. Therefore, place the following script on a local directory.

Then it runs the four processors nuweb, \LaTeX{}, MakeIndex and bib\TeX{}, until
they do not change the auxiliary file or the index.

the \LaTeX{} file (ends with \verb|.tex|), the auxiliary file (ends

as a prefix to the auxiliary filename).

Repeat to copy the auxiliary file and the index file  and run the processors until the
auxiliary file and the index file are equal to their copies.
 However, since I have not yet been able to test the \verb|aux|
file and the \verb|idx| in the same test statement, currently only the
\verb|aux| file is tested.

It turns out, that sometimes a strange loop occurs in which the
\verb|aux| file will keep to change. Therefore, with a counter we
prevent the loop to occur more than m4_maxtexloops times.

\subsubsection{Create HTML files}
\label{sec:createhtml}

\textsc{Html} is easier to read on-line than a \pdf{} document that
was made for printing. We use \verb|tex4ht| to generate \HTML{}
code. An advantage of this system is, that we can include figures
in the same way as we do for \verb|pdflatex|.

To create a \textsc{html} doc, we do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a directory \texttt{m4_htmldocdir} for the \textsc{html} document.
\item Put the nuweb source in it, together with style-files that are needed (see variable \texttt{HTMLSOURCE}).
\item Put the script \texttt{w2html} in it and make it executable.
\item Execute the script \texttt{w2html}.
\end{enumerate}

Make a list of the entities that we mentioned above:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
htmldir=m4_htmldocdir
htmlsource=m4_progname<!!>.w m4_progname<!!>.bib m4_html_style m4_4ht_template w2html
htmlmaterial=\$(foreach fil, \$(htmlsource), \$(htmldir)/\$(fil))
htmltarget=$(htmldir)/m4_progname<!!>.html
@| @}

Make the directory:

@d expliciete make regels @{@%
$(htmldir) : 
	mkdir -p $(htmldir)

@| @}

The rule to copy files in it:

@d impliciete make regels  @{@%
$(htmldir)/% : % $(htmldir)
	cp $< $(htmldir)/

@| @}

Do the work:

@d expliciete make regels @{@%
$(htmltarget) : $(htmlmaterial) $(htmldir) 
	cd $(htmldir) && chmod 775 w2html
	cd $(htmldir) && ./w2html nlpp.w

@| @}

Invoke:

@d  make targets @{@%
htm : $(htmldir) $(htmltarget)

@| @}



@% Nuweb creates a \LaTeX{} file that is suitable
@% for \verb|latex2html| if the source file has \verb|.hw| as suffix instead of
@% |.w|. However, this feature is not compatible with tex4ht.
@% 
@% To generate \texttt{html} we need a directory with the following:
@% \begin{itemize}
@% \item Source file \texttt{m4_progname<!!>.w} and bib file \texttt{m4_progname<!!>.bib} 
@% \item Style files \texttt{m4_html_style} and \texttt{m4_4ht_template}.
@% \item Script \texttt{w2html} that generates the \textsc{html} document.
@% @% \item Files with the images (\texttt{.pstex}) and \texttt{pstex_t})
@% \end{itemize}
@% 


@% @d parameters in Makefile @{@%
@% _PS_FIG_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), m4_htmldocdir/\$(fil).pstex)

The script is very much like the \verb|w2pdf| script, but at this
moment I have still difficulties to compile the source smoothly into
\textsc{html} and that is why I make a separate file and do not
recycle parts from the other file. However, the file works similar.

The user provides the name of the nuweb file as argument. Strip the
extension (e.g.\ \verb|.w|) from the filename and create the names of
the \LaTeX{} file (ends with \verb|.tex|), the auxiliary file (ends
with \verb|.aux|) and the copy of the auxiliary file (add \verb|old.|
as a prefix to the auxiliary filename).

@d filenames in w2html @{@%

When the compilation has been satisfied, run makeindex in a special

\subsection{Create the program sources}
\label{sec:createsources}

Run nuweb, but suppress the creation of the \LaTeX{} documentation.
Nuweb creates only sources that do not yet exist or that have been
modified. Therefore make does not have to check this. However,
``make'' has to create the directories for the sources if they
do not yet exist.
@%This is especially important for the directories
@%with the \HTML{} files. It seems to be easiest to do this with a shell
@%script.
So, let's create the directories first.

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
MKDIR = mkdir -p

@| MKDIR @}



@d make targets @{@%
DIRS = @< directories to create @>

\$(DIRS) : 
	\$(MKDIR) \$@@

@d make scripts executable @{@%

@d make targets @{@%

@%	cp ./createdirs m4_bindir/createdirs
@%	cd m4_bindir && chmod 775 createdirs
@%	m4_bindir/createdirs
	\$(NUWEB) m4_progname.w

@% \subsection{Restore paths after transplantation}
@% \label{sec:paths-restore}
@% 
@% When an existing installation has been transplanted to another
@% location, many path indications have to be adapted to the new
@% situation. The scripts that are generated by nuweb can be repaired by
@% re-running nuweb. After that, configuration files of some modules must

@% after a transplantation.
